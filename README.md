# Static-reports

Static reports to visualize data generated by Windup CLI.

## Development

- Install npm dependencies:

```
npm ci
```

- The UI allows to visualize the data generated by Windup CLI but it does not generate it. Therefore we need to first generate the data using Windup CLI:

```bash
$WINDUP_HOME/bin/windup-cli --input /home/username/my_app.jar --target eap8
```

The previous command generated a report folder. Let's set the enviroment variable `WINDUP_REPORT_PATH` to point to the generated report folder. E.g.

```
export WINDUP_REPORT_PATH=/home/username/my_app.jar.report
```

- The data that the UI will consume will come from the report generated in the previous step. Let's serve the data using NodeJS

```bash
node server.js
```

- Start the UI in development mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

- Access to the UI using http://localhost:3000
